# The final data story
https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/navigating-new-yorks-real-estate-maze/ 

From a young age, I've been captivated by the allure of New York City, particularly its dynamic real estate market. My dream of owning a home in the financial heart of the United States has driven me to delve deeply into this vibrant market. This project, born from a personal ambition and a professional interest in Fintech, aims to uncover the intricate factors influencing property prices in New York City. It is tailored to provide valuable insights for potential homebuyers, especially those belonging to Gen Z.

# Building on Foundations: From Parts I and II to III

The project began with a personal aspiration and professional interest, which set the tone for Part I. Here, I started with the NYC real estate sales data[1], focusing on visualizations to extract preliminary insights. It was a stage of exploring and understanding the basic dynamics of the market.

In Part II, the scope expanded. By integrating the Building Class dataset[2], I could delve deeper into the nuances of the market. This phase was crucial for shaping the final analysis, as it involved data cleaning, understanding price trends, the impact of building age, and examining sales patterns across boroughs and zip codes.

# Part III: Deepening the Analysis

In this final part, I made several key advancements:

- **Audience Identification:** Through interviews and interactions, I identified the target audience for my final data story as young professionals and Gen Z individuals considering property investment in NYC. This influenced how I presented my findings, ensuring they were relatable and useful for this demographic.
- **Incorporating Additional Datasets:** I added the Livability Index [3] and Facilities dataset[4] from NYC.gov to my analysis. This allowed me to explore factors beyond basic sales data, such as public amenities and their distribution across different boroughs, providing a more comprehensive view of what influences property choices.
- **Refining Data Visualizations:** Based on feedback and the identified audience's preferences, I focused on creating more interactive and engaging visualizations. This included clearer, more intuitive charts and graphs that could be easily understood by a non-technical audience.
- **Narrative Development:** My story initially centered around straightforward visualizations and analysis. I then incorporated a clear call to action and made the narrative more engaging for Gen Z audiences. The story was structured to guide them through understanding the dynamics of NYC's real estate market, culminating in actionable insights.
- **Link to External Resources:** I included a link in the final narrative, directing readers to additional resources for a detailed analysis of buying a house in NYC. This link will eventually be updated to direct to my personal webpage, where I plan to continue sharing insights.

# Reflections and Key Learnings
This project has been a journey of growth and learning. One of the main takeaways was the importance of audience-centric storytelling in data science. Adapting complex data into a narrative that resonates with a specific audience requires understanding their needs and preferences.

I also learned the value of iterative development and feedback. Each piece of feedback helped refine the project, making it more relevant and impactful. Balancing detailed data analysis with clear, accessible presentation was a continuous learning process.

# Final thoughts
I liked working on this project. The dataset has a lot to offer and lots of additional things which can be considered to support the analysis. There were some anomalies present in the dataset and some outliers which I would have liked to address if I had more time. Some spikes in few of the graphs that I analyzed seem wierd. I was most excited to see how different factors have a play in the prices of houses in NYC and how those need to be considered and understood properly before buying a property in NYC. 

In future, I would like to include more detailed analysis from different datasets and make a comparison on how these prices compare with California which is the second most preferred destination in the United States.
